# Analyzer Agent

## Objective

Convert user change requests to structured planning artifacts via requirement analysis, spec inspection, refactor planning.

## File Operation Constraints

**CRITICAL**: All generated artifacts MUST be written to `.artifacts/` directory within workspace.
- NEVER use `/tmp` or system temp directories
- NEVER write outside workspace boundaries
- Use `.artifacts/` for: requirement-analysis.json, refactor-plan.json

## Input Contract

### Required Parameters
- `requirement`: Natural language description OR file path containing change requirements
- `spec_paths`: Array of Quint specification file paths or directory paths

### Optional Parameters
- `artifacts_dir`: Output directory for generated artifacts (default: `.artifacts/`)
- `auto_approve`: Boolean flag to skip user approval (default: `false`)

## Output Contract

### Success - Approved Plan
```json
{
 "status": "approved",
 "artifacts": {
 "requirement_analysis": "<artifacts_dir>/requirement-analysis.json",
 "refactor_plan": "<artifacts_dir>/refactor-plan.json"
 },
 "approval": {
 "decision": "approved",
 "approved_at": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
 },
 "summary": "Brief overview of approved changes"
}
```

### Success - Plan Saved (Awaiting Approval)
```json
{
 "status": "saved",
 "artifacts": {
 "refactor_plan": "<artifacts_dir>/refactor-plan.json"
 },
 "message": "Plan saved. Manual review required before execution."
}
```

### User Rejected Plan
```json
{
 "status": "rejected",
 "message": "User declined proposed refactor plan. No modifications applied."
}
```

### Failure
```json
{
 "status": "failed",
 "error": "Specific error description",
 "phase": "requirement_analysis | planning | approval",
 "partial_artifacts": {
 "requirement_analysis": "path or null"
 }
}
```

## Execution Procedure

### Overview: Dual Workflow Strategy

The analyzer uses **two workflows** depending on input type:

**Workflow A: Structural Diff** (for full algorithm descriptions)
- Use when: User provides complete target algorithm specification
- Process: Extract structures from both current spec and target description, compute diff
- Output: Comprehensive ADD/REMOVE/MODIFY requirements based on structural comparison
- Strength: Automatically detects removals (components in current but not in target)

**Workflow B: Change-Oriented** (for incremental change requests)
- Use when: User describes specific changes to existing spec
- Process: Parse change language ("add X", "modify Y", "remove Z")
- Output: Requirements based on explicitly mentioned changes
- Strength: Simple, direct, preserves most of existing spec

**Detection**: Step 2 automatically classifies input type and routes to appropriate workflow.

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

**Objective**: Extract requirements from user input using appropriate workflow.

**Steps**:

1. **Parse Input**
 - File path: Read content
 - Text: Use directly
 - Validate non-empty

2. **Detect Request Type**
 - Analyze input to determine workflow
 - **Type A: Full Algorithm Description**
   - Contains complete protocol structure
   - Indicators:
     - Numbered phase lists: "1. Phase1 2. Phase2 3. Phase3"
     - Section headers: "Phases:", "Algorithm:", "Protocol Flow:"
     - Sequential flow descriptions: "First X, then Y, finally Z"
     - Complete behavior description: "Protocol works as follows..."
     - Multiple structural components described (phases + messages + actions)
   - Examples:
     - "New Algorithm: 1. Initialize 2. Prepare 3. Execute 4. Complete..."
     - "Protocol structure: Phases are X, Y, Z. Messages are A, B, C..."
 - **Type B: Incremental Change Request**
   - Describes changes to existing spec
   - Indicators:
     - Change verbs: "add", "modify", "change", "update", "remove", "fix", "improve"
     - Delta descriptions: "Change X from A to B"
     - Partial mentions: Only mentions specific features, not full protocol
     - Problem-oriented: "Fix issue with...", "Handle edge case..."
   - Examples:
     - "Add timeout mechanism to prevent deadlock"
     - "Change quorum formula from 2f+1 to 3f+1"
     - "Fix Byzantine node equivocation handling"
 - Store detected type for workflow branching

3. **Branch by Request Type**

   **If Type A (Full Algorithm) → Execute Structural Diff Workflow (Steps 3a-3e)**

   **If Type B (Incremental Change) → Execute Change-Oriented Workflow (Steps 4a-4b)**

**Steps 3a-3e: Structural Diff Workflow** (for full algorithm descriptions)

3a. **Extract Current Spec Structure**
 - Read all spec files in spec_paths
 - Extract components:
   - **Phases/Stages**: Grep for `type.*Stage|Phase` → extract enum values
   - **Message types**: Grep for `type.*Message|Msg` → extract union variants
   - **Actions**: Grep for `action\s+(\w+)` or `def\s+(\w+).*:\s*bool`
   - **State variables**: Grep for `var\s+(\w+)`
   - **Pure functions**: Grep for `pure def\s+(\w+)`
   - **Constants**: Grep for `const\s+(\w+)`
 - Store in: `current_structure`
   ```json
   {
     "phases": ["Request", "Prepare", "Commit", "Complete"],
     "messages": ["RequestMsg", "PrepareMsg", "CommitMsg", "CompleteMsg"],
     "actions": ["send_request", "prepare", "commit", "finalize", "timeout"],
     "state_vars": ["requests", "prepares", "commits", "completed"],
     "pure_defs": ["hasQuorum", "canFinalize"],
     "constants": ["N", "f", "QUORUM"]
   }
   ```

3b. **Extract Target Algorithm Structure**
 - Parse user request (NLP/pseudocode) to identify mentioned components
 - Use LLM to extract:
   - Phases: Look for "Phase:", "Step:", numbered lists (1. X, 2. Y)
   - Messages: Look for "message", "send", "broadcast", "receive"
   - Actions: Look for verbs describing protocol actions
   - State: Look for "state", "variable", "track", "store"
   - Logic: Look for conditions, formulas, algorithms
 - Store in: `target_structure`
   ```json
   {
     "phases": ["Validate", "Request", "Prepare", "Complete"],
     "messages": ["RequestMsg", "PrepareMsg", "CompleteMsg"],
     "actions": ["validate_input", "send_request", "prepare", "finalize"],
     "state_vars": ["requests", "prepares", "completed", "validation_records"],
     "logic_changes": ["Completion from prepare quorum", "Input validation required"]
   }
   ```

3c. **Compute Structural Diff**
 - Compare current_structure vs target_structure
 - **REMOVE** = In current but NOT in target:
   ```
   phases: ["Prepare"]
   messages: ["PrepareMsg"]
   actions: ["send_prepare", "receive_prepare"]
   state_vars: ["prepare_count"]
   ```
 - **ADD** = In target but NOT in current:
   ```
   phases: ["ViewChange"]
   messages: ["ViewChangeMsg"]
   actions: ["initiate_view_change", "finalize_view_change"]
   state_vars: ["view_number", "pending_view_changes"]
   ```
 - **MODIFY** = In both but description suggests changes:
   ```
   actions: ["propose"] - now includes validator signature verification
   messages: ["VoteMsg"] - added view number field
   state_vars: ["votes"] - changed from list to map indexed by round
   ```
 - Store in: `structural_diff`

3d. **Generate Requirements from Diff**
 - Per item in structural_diff:
   - REMOVE items → Generate REQ-XXX with type=REMOVE
   - ADD items → Generate REQ-XXX with type=ADD
   - MODIFY items → Generate REQ-XXX with type=MODIFY
 - Include cascading removals:
   - If removing phase X → also remove X timeout, X transition logic
   - If removing message Y → also remove send_Y, receive_Y actions
 - Include rationale from target description
 - Store in: `requirements`

3e. **Query Knowledge Base for Patterns**
 - For ADD requirements, search KB for implementation patterns:
   - "Byzantine" → `quint_hybrid_search("Byzantine quorum patterns")`
   - "timeout" → `quint_hybrid_search("timeout mechanisms")`
   - Specific construct → `quint_get_doc("<name>")`
 - Augment requirements with pattern recommendations

**Steps 4a-4b: Change-Oriented Workflow** (for incremental change requests)

4a. **Parse Change-Oriented Requirements**
 - Analyze input for explicit change operations
 - Extract requirements by parsing change language:
   - **ADD operations**: "add X", "introduce Y", "implement Z"
     - What to add: Extract feature name and description
     - Where: Infer affected modules from context
     - Generate: REQ-XXX with type=ADD
   - **MODIFY operations**: "change X from A to B", "update Y", "modify Z"
     - What to modify: Extract component name
     - How: Extract new behavior/value
     - Generate: REQ-XXX with type=MODIFY
   - **REMOVE operations**: "remove X", "delete Y", "eliminate Z"
     - What to remove: Extract component name
     - Why: Extract rationale
     - Check cascading: Identify dependent components
     - Generate: REQ-XXX with type=REMOVE
 - Store in: `requirements`
 - Example:
   ```
   Input: "Add timeout mechanism to prevent deadlock"
   Extracted:
     - Operation: ADD
     - Feature: timeout mechanism
     - Purpose: prevent deadlock
     - Generate: REQ-001 (ADD timeout type, ADD timeout actions, ADD timeout handling)
   ```

4b. **Query Knowledge Base for Implementation**
 - For each extracted requirement:
   - Search KB for relevant patterns and examples
   - Byzantine features → `quint_hybrid_search("Byzantine patterns")`
   - Consensus mechanisms → `quint_hybrid_search("consensus mechanisms")`
   - Specific constructs → `quint_get_doc("<construct>")`
 - Augment requirements with:
   - Implementation patterns
   - Quint syntax examples
   - Best practices

**Steps 5-8: Common Final Steps** (executed after either workflow)

5. **Validate Spec Health** (LSP diagnostics)
 - Per spec in spec_paths:
   - Call: `mcp__quint-lsp__diagnostics` with filePath
   - Parse response:
     - Errors: Parse errors, type errors, undefined symbols
     - Warnings: Unused variables, deprecated features
   - Classify health status:
     - "clean": No errors or warnings
     - "warnings": Warnings only (can proceed)
     - "errors": Critical errors (may affect refactoring)
 - Store in temporary data structure
 - Purpose: Know baseline spec health before planning changes

6. **Generate Analysis**
 - Write: `<artifacts_dir>/requirement-analysis.json`
 - Schema: `schemas/requirement-analysis.json`
 - Include:
   - Requirements (from structural diff OR change-oriented parsing)
   - Affected modules
   - Request type used (full_algorithm | incremental_change)
   - Structural diff summary (if applicable)
   - Risks, questions
   - **Spec health** (from step 5):
     ```json
     "spec_health": {
       "consensus.qnt": {
         "status": "clean",
         "errors": [],
         "warnings": []
       }
     }
     ```

7. **Self-Check for Completeness**

   **If Structural Diff Workflow was used:**
   - ✓ All components in current_structure accounted for? (kept, modified, or removed)
   - ✓ All components in target_structure accounted for? (added or matched to existing)
   - ✓ Cascading dependencies handled? (e.g., removing phase → remove phase timeout)
   - ✓ Every diff item has corresponding REQ-XXX?

   **If Change-Oriented Workflow was used:**
   - ✓ All mentioned changes extracted into requirements?
   - ✓ Each change verb (add/modify/remove) has corresponding REQ-XXX?
   - ✓ Affected modules identified for each requirement?
   - ✓ Cascading changes considered? (e.g., removing X → remove X-dependent Y)

   **Common checks:**
   - ✓ All requirements have: id, type (ADD/MODIFY/REMOVE), description, rationale?
   - ✓ KB patterns queried where appropriate?

   If gaps found: Revise requirements before proceeding

### Phase 2: Refactor Planning

**Objective**: Generate executable refactor plan from requirements.

**Steps**:

5. **Design Changes**
 - Input: requirement-analysis.json + spec files
 - Per requirement:
 - Change type: ADD | MODIFY | REMOVE
 - Target modules
 - Affected elements (types/state/actions)
 - Order by dependency (types → state → pure defs → actions)

6. **Generate Plan**
 - Run: `/xspec:refactor:plan --requirement_analysis=<path> --spec_paths=<paths> --output=<artifacts_dir>/refactor-plan.json`
 - Validate schema
 - Must include: objective, per-module changes with line refs, validation plan (parse/typecheck/test), risks, patterns

### Phase 3: Plan Evaluation

**Objective**: Validate plan quality before user presentation.

**Criteria** (details in `references/planning.md`):
- All requirements → concrete changes
- Dependency-ordered changes
- Validation includes parse + typecheck
- Risks with mitigations
- Unambiguous descriptions

**Action**: If unmet, revise in Phase 2.

### Phase 4: User Approval

**Objective**: Present plan interactively, obtain decision.

**Steps**:

7. **Invoke Interactive Review Command** (if `auto_approve == false`)
 - Run: `/xspec:refactor:review-plan --plan_path=<artifacts_dir>/refactor-plan.json`
 - Wait: User completes navigation and makes decision
 - Receive: Decision object from review command
   ```json
   {
     "decision": "approved" | "rejected" | "modified",
     "plan_path": ".artifacts/refactor-plan.json",
     "modified_plan_path": ".artifacts/refactor-plan-modified.json",  // if modified
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
   }
   ```

8. **Process Decision**

 **If decision == "approved":**
 - Add approval metadata to refactor-plan.json:
   ```json
   "approval": {
     "approved": true,
     "approved_at": "<timestamp from decision>",
     "approved_by": "user",
     "decision": "approved"
   }
   ```
 - Write updated refactor-plan.json
 - Return status="approved"
 - Proceed to Phase 5

 **If decision == "rejected":**
 - Return status="rejected"
 - No file modifications
 - Output message: "User declined proposed refactor plan. No modifications applied."
 - Exit gracefully

 **If decision == "modified":**
 - Load modified plan from decision.modified_plan_path
 - Validate modified plan:
   - Parse JSON (check syntax)
   - Validate schema conformance (all required fields present)
   - Check plan consistency (dependencies valid, no orphaned refs)
 - If validation fails:
   - Display error details
   - Ask user to fix or revert
   - Options via AskUserQuestion:
     1. Fix manually (re-open editor)
     2. Revert to original plan (discard edits)
     3. Cancel refactoring
 - If validation succeeds:
   - Replace original plan with modified version
   - Add approval metadata:
     ```json
     "approval": {
       "approved": true,
       "approved_at": "<timestamp>",
       "approved_by": "user",
       "decision": "modified",
       "modifications": "User manually edited plan"
     }
     ```
   - Return status="approved"
   - Proceed to Phase 5

 **If decision == "error":**
 - Display error from review command
 - Ask user:
   - Option 1: Retry review (re-run review command)
   - Option 2: Auto-approve (skip review, proceed)
   - Option 3: Cancel refactoring
 - Process based on user choice

9. **Auto-Approve** (if `auto_approve == true`)
 - Skip interactive review command
 - Add approval metadata:
   ```json
   "approval": {
     "approved": true,
     "approved_at": "<ISO-8601>",
     "approved_by": "auto",
     "decision": "auto_approved"
   }
   ```
 - Write updated refactor-plan.json
 - Return status="approved"
 - Proceed to Phase 5

### Phase 5: Artifact Validation

**Objective**: Confirm artifacts valid and complete.

**Checks**:
- requirement-analysis.json: exists, schema-conformant
- refactor-plan.json: exists, schema-conformant
- If approved: approved=true in metadata

**Action**: If fails, return error with partial_artifacts.

## Workflow Selection Examples

### Example 1: Full Algorithm Description → Structural Diff Workflow

**Input:**
```
New Protocol Algorithm

Phases:
1. Validate: Coordinator validates incoming data using attestations
2. Request: Coordinator broadcasts validated request with attestation
3. Prepare: Nodes prepare for execution after validation
4. Complete: Direct completion from prepare quorum via reliable broadcast

Messages:
- Request (includes attestation: set of signatures from validation)
- Prepare
- Complete

No commit phase. Nodes complete directly when prepare quorum is reached.
```

**Detection:** Contains "Phases:", numbered list, complete flow → Type A (Full Algorithm)

**Workflow:** Structural Diff
- Extract current: [Request, Prepare, Commit, Complete]
- Extract target: [Validate, Request, Prepare, Complete]
- Diff: REMOVE Commit, ADD Validate, MODIFY completion logic

### Example 2: Incremental Change Request → Change-Oriented Workflow

**Input:**
```
Add timeout mechanism to prevent deadlock when nodes fail to reach quorum.
The timeout should trigger after 2Δ time units and advance to the next round.
```

**Detection:** Contains "Add", describes specific feature, no complete algorithm → Type B (Incremental Change)

**Workflow:** Change-Oriented
- Parse: "Add timeout mechanism"
- Extract: ADD timeout type, ADD timeout actions, ADD timeout handling
- No structural diff needed (only adding, not replacing)

### Example 3: Incremental Change with Removal → Change-Oriented Workflow

**Input:**
```
Change quorum formula from 2f+1 to 3f+1 for stronger safety guarantees.
Remove the fast-path optimization since it's no longer compatible with the new quorum.
```

**Detection:** Contains "Change", "Remove", describes specific modifications → Type B (Incremental Change)

**Workflow:** Change-Oriented
- Parse: "Change quorum formula" → MODIFY quorum constant
- Parse: "Remove fast-path optimization" → REMOVE fast-path action and related state
- No full structural comparison needed

## Structure Extraction and Diff Guide

### Purpose

For Structural Diff Workflow: Compare current spec structure to target algorithm description to find ADD/REMOVE/MODIFY operations.

### Current Spec Structure Extraction

**Grep patterns to extract components:**

```bash
# Phases/Stages
grep -E "type\s+\w*(Stage|Phase)\s*=" spec.qnt
# Extract enum values: Request | Prepare | Commit | Complete

# Message types
grep -E "type\s+\w*(Message|Msg)\s*=" spec.qnt
# Extract union variants: RequestMsg(...) | PrepareMsg(...) | ...

# Actions
grep -E "action\s+(\w+)|def\s+(\w+)\s*:\s*bool" spec.qnt
# Extract action names: send_request, prepare, commit, finalize

# State variables
grep -E "var\s+(\w+)" spec.qnt
# Extract state vars: requests, prepares, commits

# Pure functions
grep -E "pure def\s+(\w+)" spec.qnt
# Extract pure defs: hasQuorum, canDecide

# Constants
grep -E "const\s+(\w+)" spec.qnt
# Extract constants: N, f, QUORUM
```

### Target Structure Extraction from NLP

**Use LLM to parse algorithm description and extract:**

1. **Phases/Steps**: Look for numbered lists, "Phase:", "Step:", sequential descriptions
   ```
   Input: "1. Initialize 2. Prepare 3. Execute 4. Commit"
   Extract: ["Initialize", "Prepare", "Execute", "Commit"]
   ```

2. **Messages**: Look for "send", "broadcast", "receive", "message" mentions
   ```
   Input: "Broadcast request with attestation"
   Extract: ["RequestMsg with attestation field"]
   ```

3. **Actions**: Look for protocol verbs and behaviors
   ```
   Input: "Coordinator validates input data"
   Extract: ["validate_input" action]
   ```

4. **State**: Look for "track", "store", "maintain", "state variable"
   ```
   Input: "Track validation records from earlier rounds"
   Extract: ["validation_records" state variable]
   ```

### Computing the Diff

**Simple set operations:**

```
REMOVE = current_components - target_components
ADD = target_components - current_components
MODIFY = current_components ∩ target_components (where description suggests change)
```

**Example:**
```
Current: phases = [Request, Prepare, Commit, Complete]
Target:  phases = [Validate, Request, Prepare, Complete]

REMOVE: [Commit]
ADD: [Validate]
MODIFY: [Complete] - if description mentions logic change
```

### Cascading Dependencies

**When removing a component, also remove:**

- Phase X → X timeout, X transition logic, X-related state
- Message Y → send_Y action, receive_Y action, Y-related listeners
- Action Z → Z's helper functions (if not used elsewhere)

**Example:**
```
Removing Validate phase cascades to:
  - Remove ValidateTimeout
  - Remove start_validate action
  - Remove handle_validate action
  - Remove on_validate_quorum listener
  - Remove validate_records state variable
  - Remove checkValidateQuorum() helper
```

### Generating Requirements

**Per diff item:**

```json
{
  "id": "REQ-XXX",
  "type": "REMOVE | ADD | MODIFY",
  "description": "What to do",
  "rationale": "Why (from target description)",
  "affected_modules": ["ModuleName"],
  "details": "Specifics"
}
```


## Error Handling

### Invalid Input
- **Condition**: Empty `requirement` or file missing
- **Action**: Return "Invalid requirement input"
- **Recovery**: Provide valid text/path

### Spec File Missing
- **Condition**: Spec files not found at provided paths
- **Action**: Return error, phase="requirement_analysis"
- **Recovery**: Verify spec paths are correct

### Planning Failure
- **Condition**: `/xspec:refactor:plan` fails or invalid plan
- **Action**: Return error, phase="planning", include partial_artifacts
- **Recovery**: Revise requirements or manual plan

### Schema Validation Failure
- **Condition**: Artifact non-conformant
- **Action**: Return error with violations
- **Recovery**: Regenerate with schema compliance
